# Gecko Codes by Krohnos

This repository is for custom gecko codes I've made! Feel free to send me requests via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cnkeats) or Discord <sub><sup>(Krohnos#1254).<sup><sub>

Unless otherwise stated, all codes are mutually exclusive - contact me if you want a specific combo.

<br>

## [Mango Axe Wednesday](mango-axe-wednesday.ini) <sub><sup>v1.0</sup></sub>
Mango Axe Wednesday for rollback! Items on at High frequency with Cloaking Device, Heart Container, Maxim Tomato, Starman, and Food disabled. Only illegal stages chosen when picking a random stage. 2 stocks. 2 minutes. Unfortunately does not include Sudden Death.

<br>

## [No Ego Mode](no-ego-mode.ini) <sub><sup>v1.1</sup></sub>
From the mind of [Ginger](https://twitter.com/SsbmGinger/status/1470532447075024897) - a game mode where you and your opponent each have a random number of stocks, 1 to 6, and you can't see your current stock count. Throw the ego away because you might not have another stock to sacrifice!

<br>

## [B Button Mode](b-button-mode.ini) <sub><sup>v1.2</sup></sub>
Inspired by [Drephen](https://twitter.com/Drephen/status/1476395174695682049) - a game mode where L, R, Z, A, and the C-stick are disabled. 2 stocks, 5 minutes. All combos will be as Sakurai intended!

<br>

## [No X / Y](no-xy.ini) <sub><sup>v1.0</sup></sub>
Removes X and Y to force tap-jumping. Combine with a code that turns off tap-jumping to disable jumping altogether!

<br>

## [Online Break The Targets](online-stadium.ini) <sub><sup>v0.2 EXTREMELY EXPERIMENTAL</sup></sub>
WIP code for playing BTT via Slippi Netplay. Several known issues such as some stages having bad spawn points.

<br>

## [Rishi's Jungle Jam](rishis-jungle-jam.ini) <sub><sup>v1.0</sup></sub>
Sets the rules to [Rishi's Jungle Jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SA_U6JoA7g) - 3 stocks, 8 minutes, Starman as the only item on Very Low frequency. Applies to every stage because I am lazy!

<br>

## [99 Stocks, No Timer](99-stocks-no-timer.ini) <sub><sup>v1.1</sup></sub>
Requested by [PGH Carroll](https://twitter.com/OhgirlNC) for online [99-Stock Interviews](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeGlnaSlOss2bVIJXYc9d_KSwciMWc1ki).

<br>

## [Rollback Items](rollback-items.ini) <sub><sup>v1.0</sup></sub>
