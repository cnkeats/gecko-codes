# Gecko Codes by Krohnos

### This repository is for custom gecko codes I've made! Feel free to send me requests via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cnkeats) or Discord <sub><sup>(Krohnos#1254).<sup><sub>

## [No Ego Mode](no-ego-mode.ini) <sub><sup>v1.1</sup></sub>
From the mind of [Ginger](https://twitter.com/SsbmGinger/status/1470532447075024897) - a game mode where you and your opponent each have a random number of stocks, 1 to 6, and you can't see your current stock count. Throw the ego away because you might not have another stock to sacrifice!

<br>

## [B Button Mode](b-button-mode.ini) <sub><sup>v1.0</sup></sub>
Inspired by [Drephen](https://twitter.com/Drephen/status/1476395174695682049) - a game mode where L, R, Z, X, Y, A, and the C-stick are disabled. 2 stocks, 5 minutes. All combos will be as Sakurai intended!
